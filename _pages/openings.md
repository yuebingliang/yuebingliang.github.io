## Ph.D./Master Students
Dr. Yuebing Liang at Tsinghua University (THU) is seeking highly motivated Ph.D. and Master’s students with a strong interest in the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence, human mobility, and urban planning. Research topics may include, but are not limited to: human mobility modeling, spatiotemporal data mining, Generative AI for urban planning, big data and travel behavior analysis, and social computing and urban AI. We welcome students from diverse academic backgrounds, particularly:
* Background (type 1): major in urban planning, urban management, GIS, landscape, human geography, or architecture, but also with background and strong interests in machine learning, statistics, and other advanced technical background.
* Background (type 2): major in transportation, civil engineering, computer science, or other engineering fields, but with strong interests in smart city applications.

**Note**: For those targeting admission in Fall 2026, early contact is strongly encouraged—ideally by July 2025. Please refer to the Department of Urban Planning under the School of Architecture at Tsinghua University for application procedures and deadlines.

## Research Assistant (RA)
Part-time and full-time Research Assistant (RA) positions are available for students or junior researchers interested in gaining hands-on research experience in preparation for a future academic or research career.

The expectations and qualifications for RAs are similar to those for graduate students. Ideal candidates should demonstrate strong motivation, relevant academic training, and a passion for research in AI and urban science.
