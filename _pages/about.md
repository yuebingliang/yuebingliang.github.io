Dr. Yuebing Liang is a postdoc associate at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology ([SMART](https://m3s.mit.edu/our-team/yuebing-liang)), advised by [Prof. Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao). She is also an incoming assistant professor and PhD supervisor based in the Department of Urban Planning at Tsinghua University ([THU](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Departments)) (expected start date: July 2025).  Her research interests lie in the intersection of articifial intelligence, urban science, and human mobility. In particular, her research integrates advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence into spatiotemporal data analysis for analyzing human behavior, characterizing urban dynamics, and designing new mobility solutions.

Prior to that, she earned her Ph.D. degree in Urban Planning and Design (Transportation) from The University of Hong Kong ([HKU](https://www.arch.hku.hk/departments-and-divisions/department-of-urban-planning-and-design/)) in 2024, supervised by Prof. Zhao Zhan, Prof. Chris Webster, Prof. Eric Schuldenfrei, and Prof. Zhou Jiangping. She was also a visiting PhD student at MIT Senseable City Lab (Boston) during 2023-2024, advised by Prof. Carlo Ratti and Prof. Paolo Santi. Before that, she received bachelor and master degrees in Architecture, and a dual-bachelor degree of Business Management from Tsinghua University.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
