Dr. Yuebing Liang is a Postdoctoral Associate at [SMART Centre, MIT](https://m3s.mit.edu/our-team/yuebing-liang). She will join the Department of Urban Planning at Tsinghua University ([THU](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Departments)) as an Assistant Professor and Ph.D. supervisor in July 2025. She earned her Ph.D. degree in Urban Planning and Design (Transportation) from The University of Hong Kong ([HKU](https://www.arch.hku.hk/departments-and-divisions/department-of-urban-planning-and-design/)) in 2024 and was also a visiting PhD student at MIT Senseable City Lab. Before that, she received bachelor and master degrees in Architecture from Tsinghua University. 

Dr. Liangâ€™s research interest lies in the intersection of articifial intelligence, human mobility and urban science. In particular, her previous research contributes to data-driven human mobility modeling using advanced machine learning techniques. Recently, her research work focuses on exploring the potential of generative artificial intelligence in shaping our future cities.
